Ping scan — Scans the list of devices up and running on a given subnet.
{nmap -sp 192.168.1.1/24 ( example ip ) }

Stealth scan - 
Stealth scanning is performed by sending an SYN packet and analyzing the response. If SYN/ACK is received, it means the port is open, and you can open a TCP connection
However there is no "three way handshake "compleated so it's hard to trace you back 
{nmap -sS scanme.nmap.org ( add sS to make it stealth mode )} 
it takes time so wait , and  it's not agressive 


Version scanning -
makes it easy if there are open vulnerabilty that alr exits in a site 
"https://cve.mitre.org/" 
makes life easier so do it
after that you can parse it through a exploit tool like metaspolit and yeah 
 {nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org}
To do a version scan, use the ‘-sV’ command. Nmap will provide a list of services with its versions. Do keep in mind that version scans are not always 100% accurate, but it does take you one step closer to successfully getting into a system
